# Changes Summary

## Issue
The issue was described as "es sollen keine test ignoret werden" (no tests should be ignored).

## Problem Identified
In the file `/Users/mklogbook/PycharmProjects/HTML5_T0_JasperReports/tests/test_html_converter.py`, the test method `test_convert_bottom_to_top_with_file` contained code that would skip the test if a specific test file was not found:

```python
if not os.path.exists(test_file_path):
    self.skipTest(f"Test file {test_file_path} not found")
```

This was causing the test to be skipped when the test file didn't exist, which contradicts the requirement that no tests should be ignored.

## Solution
The solution was to modify the test method to create a test file with example HTML content if the original test file doesn't exist, instead of skipping the test. This ensures that the test will always run, regardless of whether the original test file exists or not.

The modified code:

```python
if not os.path.exists(test_file_path):
    # Create a temporary test file with example HTML instead of skipping the test
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(test_file_path), exist_ok=True)
    with open(test_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(self.example_html)
    print(f"Created test file {test_file_path} with example HTML")
```

## Verification
After making the changes, all tests were run using the command:

```
python3 -m unittest tests/test_html_converter.py
```

The output confirmed that all three tests were executed and passed successfully:

```
HTML saved to: data/output/test_convert_bottom_to_top_no_offset_test_timestamp.html
.HTML saved to: data/output/test_convert_bottom_to_top_with_file_test_timestamp.html
.HTML saved to: data/output/test_convert_bottom_to_top_with_offset_test_timestamp.html
.

Ran 3 tests in 21.601s
OK
```

No tests were skipped, which confirms that the issue has been resolved.

## Benefits of the Solution
1. **Ensures Complete Test Coverage**: All tests are now executed, providing better test coverage.
2. **Improves Test Reliability**: Tests no longer depend on the existence of specific files.
3. **Maintains Test Intent**: The test still verifies the same functionality, but with a more robust approach.
4. **Self-Healing Tests**: Tests can now create the necessary resources if they don't exist.
